Developed a machine learning model trained on drone data
    
Conducted in-depth feature analysis by extracting trend, seasonality, and residuals from 12 time series features. Furthermore, employing advanced techniques like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and Vector Autoregression (VAR) for variable correlation determination in time
    
Analyzed residuals with Auto Correlation Function (ACF), Partial ACF, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and hypothesis testing to efficiently implement data compression via PCA and Auto-encoders
